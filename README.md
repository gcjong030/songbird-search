Unlock a world of music with a single word! Our IrvineHacks 2024 project Songbird generates a song based on your input, offering a fun and personalized music discovery experience. 

We were first inspired with the well known concepts of fortune cookies, where a fortune is given for each cookie opened. We then decided on a common interest, music, and asked ourselves what troubles we have with music. Deciding that we all struggle with finding music because of the uncertainty of how to look for random songs, we decided to create a website that generates a song based on a single word that the user gives.

Our website allows users to input a word in the given search bar, and get a randomized song based on that word in return. With the randomized song, users get the following information; song artist, song title, and album cover. This can give users a fun experience in trying to find new random songs.

Our process began with Figma, where we drafted an idea of what we wanted the website to look like. All of the website art was hand-drawn by our teammate, Grace. The title and theme of the website are based on songbirds, which are known for spreading their special vocalizations, an idea that we wanted to connect with the functionality of the website to share music with users. We used HTML and CSS for the frontend, Javascript for the backend, and we used GeniusAPI to access their music database. We also used Canva for small, decorative animations.

As beginner hackers, not only was this our first hackathon, but we had little-to-no experience with HTML, CSS, Javascript, and APIs. Everything we were able to accomplish in this project was a learning experience, and it was definitely a challenge learning the different technologies as we progressed. Nonetheless, we are grateful to have the opportunity to create something we are proud of, and we are excited to continue to learn and grow.
